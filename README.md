# Yahtzee Game

I developed and tested a game written in C, as a console application, during my spare time.
It is a fully functional Yahtzee game which plays Yahtzee with up to 4 players.
It also checks for errors, essentially sanitizing user inputs.

The code as well as the executable (.exe) file are available in this *Yahtzee-Game--Visual-Studio* Repository.
