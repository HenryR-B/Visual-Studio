## Yahtzee Game

I developed and tested a game written in C, as a console application.
It is a fully functional Yahtzee game which plays Yahtzee with up to 4 players.
It also checks for errors, essentially sanitizing user inputs.

The code as well as the .exe file are available in this *Visual-Studio* Repository.
